      <p>
        Photography and editing are key aspects of the media sub team. Media is
        a part of robotics that is non-technical. We take photos and videos of
        the progress of the robot and at competitions. Media is also in charge
        of editing videos and manipulating posters. Additionally, media creates
        the Chairman's video and the yearly recap videos, both represented
        below. All that is needed for this sub team is a camera and any editing
        software.
