      <p>
        The Electronics team takes the assembled robot and connects the various
        motors, pistons and any other vision or movement device to their
        respective controllers. We enable the robot to be controlled by our
        Drive Team, as well as autonomously during a match. We are responsible
        not only for designing, connecting, and troubleshooting the electrical
        and pneumatic components, but also for working together with the Build
        and Programming Teams to eventually build a fully functioning robot.

      <p>
        Members don't need any prerequisite knowledge in electronics as we will
        provide you with resources and workshops for you to learn the necessary
        skills, but enthusiasm and willingness to learn are important
        characteristics.
